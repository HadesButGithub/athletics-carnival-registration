// This login method has potentially the worst security ever seen in a web app, second only to Dropbox in 2011 when passwords were optional for a few hours.
// https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/

// This login method does the following wrong:
// * Stores the user credentials in plain-text as opposed to hashing at least the password
// * Stores the credentials IN THE CODE, allowing any visitor to inspect element to grab them
// * Allows the user to simply go to athleticscarnival.umbreon.zip/marshallpage and completely bypass the login ðŸ’€

// As of coding, the only protection this has is it's locally hosted and requires OAuth via Tailscale to access the web server. This will no longer exist when moved to Replit.

// Ideally, the marshalling page will check that the user has logged in through a cookie of some sort and redirect to the login page if not logged in.
// I could also hand over the entire login process to Google OAuth and only need to store an email or token on our servers.
// I don't know how to do any of this, and none of it will be implemented.
